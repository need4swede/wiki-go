# Search

Neptune features the most advanced search capabilities of any Jellyfin client. Three powerful search technologies work together to help you find anything in your library instantly.



## In This Section

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Local Index Search](/search/local-index) | Offline-capable instant search |
| [Semantic Search](/search/semantic-search) | Pre-computed thematic analysis |
| [Prompt Search](/search/prompt-search) | AI-powered conceptual search |



## Three Search Technologies

| Technology | Speed | Network | Best For |
|------------|-------|---------|----------|
| **Local Index** | < 50ms | Offline | Titles, names, genres, keywords |
| **Semantic Search** | < 50ms | Offline | Themes, tone, conceptual matches |
| **Prompt Search** | 1-3s | Required | Complex queries, plot descriptions |

All three work together. Local Index and Semantic Search provide instant results while Prompt Search handles complex AI queries.



## Local Index Search

Neptune builds a complete search database on your device. Unlike native Jellyfin search which calls the server API, Local Index Search works entirely offline with instant results.

### Why Local Index?

| Feature | Local Index | Jellyfin API |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Speed** | < 50ms | 200-500ms+ |
| **Offline** | Yes | No |
| **Typo tolerance** | "spi" → Spider-Man | Exact match |
| **Genre synonyms** | "sci-fi" → Science Fiction | Exact only |
| **Composer search** | Enriched from TMDb | Often missing |

### What's Indexed

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Titles** | "Spider-Man", "spiderman", "spider man" |
| **Genres** | "sci-fi", "scary", "funny" with synonyms |
| **People** | Cast, directors, writers, composers |
| **Studios** | Production companies |
| **Plot** | Full descriptions and overviews |

## Semantic Search

Neptune ships with semantic tags for over 4,000 movies and TV shows.

### Bundled Tags

- **4,000+ items** pre-analyzed and included
- Matched by TMDb ID for accuracy
- Works offline, no AI needed
- Additional items can be analyzed with AI

### Example Results

| Query | Instant Matches |
|-------|-----------------|
| "time travel" | Back to the Future, Interstellar, Tenet |
| "feel-good" | Forrest Gump, The Pursuit of Happyness |
| "dystopian" | The Hunger Games, Blade Runner, 1984 |
| "heist" | Ocean's Eleven, The Italian Job |

## Prompt Search

Ask for what you want in plain English. The AI understands natural language and translates it into precise search queries.

### Example Queries

| Query | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| "movie about a killer shark" | AI identifies "Jaws" |
| "farm boy learns magic fights dad" | AI identifies "Star Wars" |
| "90s action movies" | Filters by year 1990-1999 + genre |
| "movies I haven't seen" | Filters to unwatched only |
| "composed by John Williams" | Filters by composer role |

### How It Works

1. Your query goes to configured AI provider
2. AI identifies likely titles and extracts filters
3. Results searched in your local library
4. Structured filters applied

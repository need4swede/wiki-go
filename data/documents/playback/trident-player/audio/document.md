## Dolby Atmos

### What Neptune Plays

Dolby Atmos includes both a base surround track and spatial object metadata. Neptune plays:

| Format | What You Hear |
|--------|---------------|
| **TrueHD Atmos** | Full lossless 7.1 surround |
| **DD+ Atmos** | Full 7.1 surround |

### About Spatial Objects

The spatial object metadata in Atmos requires proprietary decoding that isn't available to third-party apps. Neptune delivers the full-quality base audio track - the same limitation applies to other premium players like Infuse.

## Audio Quality

### Bit-Perfect Playback

Neptune decodes lossless audio to preserve maximum quality. Your carefully selected TrueHD and DTS-HD MA tracks play with every detail intact.

### No Quality Loss

Unlike transcoding, Neptune plays your audio files directly. What's in the file is what you hear.

## Instant Track Switching

Switch between audio tracks instantly during playback:
- Change languages on the fly
- Switch to commentary tracks
- No rebuffering required

## Troubleshooting

### No Audio

1. **Check volume** - Apple TV, receiver, and TV volume
2. **Check audio track** - Ensure a track is selected in player controls
3. **Check connections** - Verify HDMI is connected properly

### Audio Delayed

**Wait for calibration** - First 1-2 seconds allow sync to stabilize.

**Try seeking** - This resets the audio sync system.

### Audio Cuts Out

**Network issues** - Try increasing buffer size in Settings.

**After seeking in TrueHD** - Brief silence (~100-200ms) is normal while audio resyncs.

### Wrong Audio Playing

**Check track selection** - Open player controls and verify the correct audio track is selected.

**Default track** - Neptune selects the default track from the file; you can change it any time.

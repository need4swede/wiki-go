# Trident Player

Neptune's powerful video player delivers cinema-quality playback on your Apple TV.

---

## Play Anything

Trident plays virtually any video file directly from your Jellyfin server - no transcoding required. While other apps force your server to convert files on-the-fly, Neptune plays them natively, preserving every detail of your carefully curated library.

### Direct Play Everything

- **MKV, MP4, AVI, MOV** and more container formats
- **H.264, H.265/HEVC, VP9, AV1** video codecs
- **4K and 8K** resolutions at full quality
- **High frame rate** content from 24fps to 60fps

No more waiting for transcodes. No more quality loss. Just press play.

## Stunning HDR

Experience your HDR content the way it was meant to be seen. Neptune automatically detects and displays all major HDR formats with proper color management.

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **HDR10** | Industry standard HDR |
| **HDR10+** | Dynamic scene-by-scene optimization |
| **HLG** | Broadcast HDR |
| **Dolby Vision** | Premium dynamic HDR |

Neptune automatically switches your TV to the correct HDR mode when playback begins - you just enjoy the picture.

## Perfect Sync

Nothing ruins a movie like audio that doesn't match the lips. Neptune keeps audio and video perfectly aligned throughout playback.

- **Automatic calibration** at playback start
- **Continuous correction** for long movie sessions
- **Instant recovery** after seeking
- **Smooth buffering** without losing sync

You'll never notice - and that's the point.

## Rich Subtitles

From simple text to beautifully styled anime subtitles, Neptune renders them all.

| Type | Formats |
|------|---------|
| **Text** | SRT, VTT, ASS/SSA |
| **Bitmap** | PGS (Blu-ray), DVD subtitles |

ASS subtitles display with their intended styling - fonts, colors, positioning, and effects. No more plain white text when the subtitle author intended something more.

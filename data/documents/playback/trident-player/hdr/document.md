# HDR & Dolby Vision

Experience your HDR content the way it was meant to be seen.

---

## Supported Formats

Neptune supports all major HDR formats:

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **HDR10** | The industry standard for 4K HDR |
| **HDR10+** | Dynamic scene-by-scene optimization |
| **HLG** | Broadcast HDR standard |
| **Dolby Vision** | Premium dynamic HDR with the best picture quality |

---

## Automatic Detection

Neptune automatically detects HDR content and configures playback appropriately. When you press play on an HDR movie:

1. Neptune identifies the HDR format
2. Your TV switches to the correct HDR mode
3. Playback begins with optimal settings

No manual configuration required.

---

## Display Mode Switching

Neptune instructs your Apple TV to switch your TV to the correct display mode for HDR content.

### What You'll See

When HDR playback starts, your TV may briefly go black as it switches modes. This is normal - your TV is reconfiguring for HDR.

### Required Setting

For automatic HDR switching to work, enable this Apple TV setting:

**Settings > Video and Audio > Match Content > Match Dynamic Range**

Without this setting, HDR content will still play but may appear washed out.

---

## Dolby Vision

### Premium Quality

Dolby Vision provides scene-by-scene optimization for the best possible picture. Neptune fully supports Dolby Vision Profiles 5, 7, and 8.

### Automatic Fallback

If your TV doesn't support Dolby Vision, Neptune automatically falls back to HDR10. You get the best quality your TV can display, automatically.

---

## Frame Rate Matching

Neptune also matches the display refresh rate to your content:

| Content | Display Refresh |
|---------|-----------------|
| Movies (24fps) | 24Hz |
| PAL content | 25Hz |
| Standard video | 30Hz |
| Sports/60fps | 60Hz |

This eliminates judder for smooth, cinema-like playback.

## Requirements

### Apple TV 4K

All Apple TV 4K models support HDR10, HLG, and Dolby Vision.

### TV Requirements

For full HDR support, your TV should:
- Support the HDR format of your content
- Be connected via HDMI 2.0 or later
- Have HDR enabled on the connected input

### HDMI Cable

For reliable 4K HDR:
- Use **Premium High Speed** or **Ultra High Speed** HDMI cables
- Poor cables can cause HDR failures, sparkles, or blackouts

---

## Troubleshooting

### Colors Look Washed Out

1. **Check Apple TV settings** - Ensure "Match Dynamic Range" is ON
2. **Check TV input settings** - Make sure HDR is enabled on the HDMI input
3. **Check your cable** - Try a certified high-speed HDMI cable

### Screen Goes Black During Playback

Brief blackouts when starting HDR content are normal - your TV is switching modes. If it persists:
- Try a different HDMI cable
- Check TV firmware updates
- Temporarily disable Match Dynamic Range to test

### HDR Badge Not Showing

If content should be HDR but doesn't show the HDR indicator:
- The file may have incorrect metadata
- Try a different encode of the same content

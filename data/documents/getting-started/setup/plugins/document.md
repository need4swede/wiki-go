# Plugin Discovery

Neptune detects compatible Jellyfin server plugins.



## Supported Plugins

| Plugin | Feature |
|--------|---------|
| **Home Sections** | Shows upcoming content from Radarr/Sonarr calendars |
| **Theme Songs** | Plays ambient music on TV series detail pages |



## Detection Process

After signing in:

1. Neptune scans your server for installed plugins
2. Detected plugins show a green "Detected" badge
3. Press **Continue** to proceed



## No Plugins?

Neptune works great without plugins. You can install them later on your Jellyfin server - Neptune detects them automatically on your next sign-in.



## Managing Plugins

Enable or disable detected plugins anytime in **Settings** > **Plugins**.
